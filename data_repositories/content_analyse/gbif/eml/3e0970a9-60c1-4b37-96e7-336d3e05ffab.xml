This marsh was affected by oil deposition following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The goals of this dataset are to 1) track changes in the phylogenetic diversity of genes that code for a key enzymes used for bacterial alkane oxidation, short and long chain, from the oil impacted sediments and soil, and 2) to contribute to an understanding of bacterial functional role in the degradation of weathered oil residues in a natural marsh system.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-12</date></data>
