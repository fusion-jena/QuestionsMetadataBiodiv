The data set has been compiled over the last 20 years by starting from the basic data of the Kew Index and the Index Filicum. These names (roughly 1 million) have been cross-checked against local floras, checklists and treatments. In the current status about 95% of the species names have been verified, and distribution data are available for about 95% of the countries and families (incomplete only for a major part of families in Malesia for Sumatra, New Guinea, Moluccas, Solomons and Lesser Sunda Islands). Countries without recent checklists include El Salvador, Rwanda, Burundi, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Laos, Equatorial Guinea, some smaller Pacific islands, Vanuatu and some families of India. The states of the former Yugoslavia have not yet been completely separated, and the sixth and last part of the Caucasus and Transcaucasus checklist has yet to appear. The listings for the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire) are partially badly outdated. Literature for Bangladesh has not yet been received completely.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-05-01</date></data>
